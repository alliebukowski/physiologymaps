                <p>The <b>resting membrane potential</b> of a cell is determined by the relative concentrations of charged ions inside the cell versus charged ions outside the cell at rest. The ions that play the biggest role in setting this resting membrane potential are potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and calcium (Ca2+).</p>
                <p>The resting membrane potential of most cells is somewhere between -70mV and -80mV. This means that, at rest, there is relatively more negative charge inside of a cell than outside the cell. </p>
