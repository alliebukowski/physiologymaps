<P>Physiology Maps is a tool to explore concepts in physiology. It was created to serve as a resource for connecting physiology concepts taught and applied throughout the pre-clinical curricula of medical school, though it may also be helpful to students in their clinical years or in other health professional schools. It is not intended to be a complete or exhaustive physiology text. It is meant to provide a framework for how different physiologic processes and systems connect to each other and a foundation on which to build a deeper understanding of pathologic processes and diseases. </P>
