                <p> The <b>sinoatrial (SA) node</b> is a small cluster of conducting cells located in the top of the right atrium. The SA node's main function is to <b>initiate the electrical signal for each heartbeat</b> that travels through our atrial myocytes, to our AV node, and through our ventricular myocytes. The SA node is therefore considered the main "pacemaker" of the heart, because the SA node's firing rate sets our heart rate. The SA node can set the heart rate because of its inherent <a href="#automaticity"><b>automaticity</b></a>, or ability to generate its own action potentials. The SA node normally initiates every wave of depolarization through the heart, because of all the cardiac myocytes that can initiate their own depolarization, the SA node has the fastest firing rate (~60-90 times per minute, a normal resting <a href="cardiac_output.html#heart_rate">heart rate</a>).</p>

This allows the membrane potential of SA nodal cells to slowly approach their firing threshold, where Ca2+ channels open and cause the upstroke. (This is different from neurons or atrial and ventricular myocytes, which must wait for a neighboring cell to depolarize and spread its signal; neurons stay at a constant resting membrane potential until a nearby signal causes it to depolarize.) These funny channels (and this constant upward climb toward the threshold potential) are the key to SA nodal cells’ <a href="#automaticity"><b>automaticity</b></a>--they don’t have to wait for a nearby cell to trigger depolarization, they can just depolarize on their own. </li></ul>

                <p>While the SA node is normally the main pacemaker of the heart and sets the <a href="cardiac_output.html#heart_rate">heart rate</a>, the AV node is the first <b>“backup” pacemaker</b> if the SA node fails, or if there is an issue conducting signal through the atria to the AV node.

                    <li><b>Plateau ("phase 2")</b>: At this point, the depolarization of the cell (with the influx of Na+ in phase 0) triggers Ca2+ influx. This is just a little delayed, which is why K+ has already started to try to repolarize the cell. This influx of Ca2+ is the whole purpose for the electrical signaling in the heart: we want to bring in a lot of Ca2+ to the cell, because <b>this Ca2+ influx helps trigger heart muscle contraction</b>. In this phase, Ca2+ is flowing into the cell, but K+ is still flowing out (still trying to repolarize), so the net effect is that we have a plateau with roughly equal positive charge coming in and going out.</li>
                    <li><b>Repolarization (“phase 3”)</b>: Ca2+ channels start to close, so the K+ flowing out of the cell predominates and brings our membrane potential back down to its resting/polarized state (and closer to K+'s equilibrium potential).

                <p> The main difference between atrial myocyte and ventricular myocyte action potentials is that <b>ventricular myocytes have wider action potentials with a longer plateau (phase 2)</b>.

                <p> Unlike SA and AV nodal cells (which are only "conducting cells"), the atrial and ventricular myocytes <i>both</i> a.) <b>receive and pass on electrical signal</b>, <i>and</i> b.) are "contractile cells" and must <b>undergo muscle contraction</b> during each heartbeat.</p>

                <p> <b>"Excitation-contraction coupling"</b> is a general term used to describe the fact that cardiac myocytes 1.) receive electrical signal that causes them to depolarize ("<b>excitation</b>"), <i>and</i> this excitation triggers the myocyte to 2.) initiate the process of muscle <b>contraction</b>.</p>

                <p> <b>The key that links the "excitation" and "contraction" steps is Ca2+.</b> The whole point of sending electrical signal through the heart is to get Ca2+ into myocytes so they can contract. When action potentials reach the myocyte and they depolarize, the influx of Na+ triggers Ca2+ channels to open, creating the <b>Ca2+ influx during the plateau phase (phase 2)</b> of the atrial and ventricular myocyte action potential. This Ca2+ influx triggers <b>"Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release"</b>, because the sudden influx of Ca2+ into the cell during the action potential opens up another set of Ca2+ channels on the sarcoplasmic reticulum of the cell, allowing even more Ca2+ to be available. The Ca2+ is directly used by the muscle cells to initiate muscle contraction. The more Ca2+ that is available, the greater the force that can be generated during contraction. </p>

This would result in an uncoordinated contraction, and our ventricles would not be able to contract all together and generate the contractile force needed to pump blood out to our lungs/body. So, once the electrical signal hits the AV node, it <i>both</i> a.) starts depolarizing nearby ventricular myocytes <i>and</i> b.) starts traveling down the His-Purkinje "fast track".

                <p> <b>"Automaticity"</b> refers to the <b>ability of cardiac cells to spontaneously generate their own action potentials</b>. In other words, they do not have to wait for a nearby cell to send it a signal in order to depolarize--they can depolarize on their own. SA nodal cells, AV nodal cells, and cells of the His-Purkinje system can all generate their own action potentials. However, they all have different firing rates.
                <ul><li><a href="#sa_node"><b>SA nodal cells</b></a> typically fire at a rate of 60-90 times per minute</li>
                    <li><a href="av_node"><b>AV nodal cells</b></a> typically fire at a rate of 40-60 times per minute</li>
                    <li><a href="his_purkinje"><b>His-Purkinje cells</b></a> typically fire at a rate of 20-40 times per minute</li></ul>


                <p>The <b>SA node has the fastest rate of spontaneous depolarization</b>. This means that the SA node reaches its firing threshold more quickly than the AV node or His-Purkinje cells. So, under normal circumstances, the SA node will go off before the AV node ever reaches its firing threshold, and this will start the wave of depolarization throughout the heart. Therefore, the AV node doesn't need to use its automaticity function under normal circumstances: it will always just receive the signal traveling from the SA node first. This is why <b>the SA node is considered the main pacemaker of the heart</b>--it sets our resting <a href="cardiac_output.html#heart_rate">heart rate</a> by firing about once per second. Our normal resting heart rate is the typical firing rate of the SA node (60-90 beats per minute).</p>
                <p> However, there are times <b>when the SA node doesn't fire, or when the SA node's signal never reaches the AV node</b> (eg, certain arrhythmias). In these situations, the AV node is not receiving any signal to depolarize from the SA node/atria. Thus, the AV node will just sit there, waiting to receive a signal; as the seconds tick on, the AV node's unstable resting membrane potential will finally reach its firing threshold and the AV node will depolarize on its own. This is essentially a back-up system for our heart: if something goes wrong with the SA node or the conduction in the first half of a heart beat gets messed up, the AV node has an escape route and can take over on its own. This way, our ventricles can still contract and keep our blood moving. This is why <b>the AV node is considered the back-up pacemaker of the heart</b>. However, whenever someone's AV node has to take over, they will likely present with bradycardia, since the automatic firing rate of the AV node is 40-60 beats per minute.</p>
