                <p> The autonomic nervous system is a <b>two-neuron system</b> (in contrast to the somatic nervous system, which is a one-neuron system). This means that anytime our brain tells the ANS to do something, that signal always travels through two neurons to get to its site of action. Signal travels through this 2-neuron system via neuronal action potentials.</p>
                <p><b>Neuron 1</b> originates in the central nervous system (CNS) and always releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) into its synapse (which activates <a href="#nicotinic">nicotinic receptors</a> on Neuron 2). Neuron 1 synapses onto Neuron 2 at an <b>autonomic ganglion</b>, which are basically just dedicated areas in our body where neurons synapse on each other. Thus, Neuron 1 is called the <i>preganglionic neuron</i> (before the ganglia) and Neuron 2 is called the <i>postganglionic neuron</i> (after the ganglia).</p> 
                <p><b>Neuron 2</b> then carries signal to the organ we are trying to regulate (<b>"effector organ"</b>), where it triggers a <a href="gpcr.html">G protein-coupled receptor</a> that will activate a signaling cascade to achieve specific effects in that organ. Neuron 2's neurotransmitters, the receptors it activates, and the G protein subtype it triggers all depend on whether we are dealing with the <a href="#parasympathetic"><b>parasympathetic nervous system</b></a> or the <a href="#sympathetic"><b>sympathetic nervous system</b></a>.</p>

                <p> <b>Nicotinic receptors</b> in the ANS are found on the postganglionic neuron (the start of the 2nd neuron in the 2-neuron chain). Nicotinic receptors are <b>activated by acetylcholine</b> traveling from Neuron 1 to Neuron 2. Once activated, they <b>directly open Na+ channels</b> in Neuron 2, which starts Neuron 2's action potential, allowing the neuronal signal to propagate toward the effector organ. Nicotinic receptors are an example of an <a href="neurons.html#c_synapse_ion">ionotropic receptor</a>, since they directly open an ion channel to achieve their effects.</p>
                <p><b>Note:</b> Nicotinic receptors can also be found on skeletal muscle (where a neuron releases acetylcholine into the neuromuscular junction to initiate voluntary movement). However, this is considered part of the somatic nervous system, not the autonomic nervous system.</p>

                <p> There are two main groups of organs that are regulated by the autonomic nervous system: 1.) <b>smooth muscle</b> and 2.) <b>the heart</b>. They are called "effector organs" because they are the organs where we want to create some autonomic effect that will help us either "rest and digest" (<a href="#parasympathetic">parasympathetic</a> effects) or "fight or flight" (<a href="#sympathetic">sympathetic</a> effects). </p>
                <p><b>Smooth muscle</b> is found in many different organs of our body, including blood vessels (to constrict or dilate), the GI tract (to increase or decrease motility), the eye (to dilate or constrict the pupil), the bladder wall, and GI and bladder sphincters. The parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the ANS affect these smooth muscles in different ways to help us achieve our normal bodily functions; these effects are detailed below.</p>
                <p>The <a href="ans_reg_heart.html"><b>heart</b> is also under tight autonomic regulation</a>. The ANS controls our heart rate (<a href="ans_reg_heart.html#chronotropic">chronotropic effects</a>), the contractility of our cardiac myocytes (<a href="ans_reg_heart.html#inotropic">inotropic effects</a>), and the conduction velocity of electrical signal through the heart (<a href="ans_reg_heart.html#dromotropic">dromotropic effects</a>). The parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the ANS have oppsite effects on these outcomes (with parasympathetic usually slowing down our heart functions, and sympathetic jacking up our heart functions).</p>
