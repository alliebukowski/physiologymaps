                <p>The typical flow of electrical signal (“wave of depolarization”) through the heart creates the characteristic shape of the EKG tracing. The typical EKG tracing includes the following parts: 1.) <b>P wave</b>, 2.) <b>PR interval</b>, 3.) <b>QRS complex</b>, 4.) <b>ST interval</b>, and 5.) <b>T wave</b>. Each of these segments directly corresponds to some <a href=heart_cells.html#electrical_signal>electrical excitation</a> event in the heart.</p>

                <p><b>EKG "leads"</b> are the electrical probes that are placed on a patient’s body that measure the <a href="heart_cells.html#electrical_signal">flow of electrical signal through their heart</a>. The average, or overall, movement of electrical signal through the heart is from the SA node in the top of the right atrium (RA) down to the botoom left corner of the left ventricle (LV). This average vector of electrical signal through the heart is depicted by the black arrow on our EKG person. The shapes of the tracings in all of the different EKG leads are slightly different because of the placement of the leads in relation to the heart's flow of electrical signal.  </p> 
                <p>Imagine each lead as just a single probe stuck on the patient’s body in the orientation shown on EKG man (this is a simplification of the actual setup). An electrical signal heading <i>toward</i> an EKG lead creates a positive deflection in that lead (a peak on the EKG tracing going up). Electrical signal heading <i>away</i> from an EKG lead creates a negative deflection in that lead (going down). </
                <p> <p>All EKG leads can be grouped together based on the region of the heart they monitor: 1.) <a href="#ekginfleads">inferior leads</a>, 2.) <a href="#ekglatleads">lateral leads</a>, 3.) <a href="#ekgantleads">anterior (or anteroseptal) leads</a>, and 4.) <a href="#ekgpostleads">posterior leads</a>. We will now walk through each of the different groupings of EKG leads, starting with Lead II (the "classic" EKG lead) and aVR (Lead II's polar opposite). </p>
                <center><img src = "images/cardio/ekg_man3.png" width="500" height="325"></center>
                <p><b>Lead II</b> is what we can think of as our “classic” EKG tracing—Lead II has all positive deflections. This is because Lead II is the most direct recipient of the overall/average "wave of depolarization" through the heart, from the SA node down to the ventricles (electrical signal is almost always traveling directly <i>toward</i> Lead II).</p>
                <p><b>aVR</b> is basically the opposite of Lead II. Since aVR is up at the right shoulder, it measures electrical activity from the perspective of the right atrium. Electrical signal is almost always traveling <i>away</i> from aVR, so aVR has all negative deflections.</p>

                <p>The <b>inferior leads (Leads II, III, and aVF)</b> are on the feet. They measure electrical activity of the heart from below (from the perspective of the inferior aspect of the heart). </p>
                <p><a href="#ekgleads">As mentioned earlier</a>, all deflections are positive in <b>Lead II</b> (“classic EKG lead”), because electrical signal is almost always flowing toward Lead II. Similarly, everything is mostly positively in <b>aVF</b>, because it’s really near Lead II. <b>Lead III</b> is a little different, just because it is both inferior and on the right side. As you can see, the average movement of electrical current in the heart is more skewed to the left; so from the perspective of lead III, the overall signal is moving at an angle, so you’ll have more equal positive and negative deflections (rather than mostly positive deflections).</p>

                <p>The <b>lateral leads (Leads aVL, I, V5, and V6)</b> are located on the left arm (aVL and I) and the left side of the chest (V5 and V6). They measure electrical activity of the left lateral side of the heart, which mainly includes the left ventricle (LV).</p> 
                <p>Lateral leads all look really similar, and they all have tall and upright R waves. This is because they primarily measure the depolarization wave across main mass of ventricles, which skews a lot toward the LV because it is much larger than the RV.</p>

                <p>The <b>anterior leads (Leads V1-V4)</b>, also sometimes called <b>anteroseptal leads</b>, are located on the chest, directly over the front (or anterior) part of the heart. They measure electrical activity of the anterior heart, which includes the right ventricle and the ventricular septum. </p>
                <p>For these leads, you have to imagine the electrical signal that is coming out of the screen towards the leads on the front of the chest. <b>V1</b> looks a lot like aVR (with mostly negative deflections), because it’s close to the right atrium, and <b>V4</b> looks like V5, due to its close proximity to the left ventricle. <b>V2</b> and <b>V3</b> are more isoelectric (more equal positive and negative deflections) because the average wave of depolarization is running more perpendicular to them (and less directly at them directly, like V4 or V5). </p>

                <p>EKGs are typically performed on patients as part of the work-up for chest pain (angina). The two most commonly tested applications of EKGs are 1.) <b>arrhythmias</b> and 2.) the <b>localization of myocardial infarctions</b> (heart attacks). </p>
                <p>In <b>arrhythmias</b>, there is some defect in the electrical conduction system of the heart, and we can see characteristic changes associated with those on EKG. </p>
                <p>***. </p>
                <p>In <b>myocardial infarctions</b>, oxygen supply to an area of the heart is cut off, usually due to occlusion of a coronary artery. This leads to ischemia of that area of myocardium, which alters the electrical signaling through that region. We can use EKG to "localize" the myocardial infarction, or determine the area where the ischemia occurred. More information on myocardial infarctions can be found by clicking the above hyperlink, but here is a summary table of myocardial infarction locations, their corresponding EKG leads, and the coronary arteries effected. </p>
