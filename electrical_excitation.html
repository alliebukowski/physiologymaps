                <p>Electrical signal flows through the heart to trigger contraction of the heart muscle cells (cardiac myocytes). The flow of electrical signal is started at the top of the heart (by the nodal cells of the SA node, in the right atrium) and is passed along to neighboring cardiac myocytes going down to the bottom of the heart (towards the left ventricle). It is often referred to as a “wave of depolarization”, because each heart cell has its own action potential and will depolarize in response to some trigger (usually the depolarization of a neighboring cell). As  heart cells pass on electrical signal on to their neighboring cells, it causes this massive spread of depolarization down the heart (in a “wave”). The whole purpose of this wave of electrical excitation is to trigger muscle contraction by the cardiac myocytes, which causes the heart to beat and pump out blood.</p>

                <p>It makes sense this electrical signal flows in the direction it does: We want the atria to contract first, in order to empty blood into the ventricles during <b>diastole</b>; then, after a pause at the AV node, we want the ventricles to contract, pushing blood out to the lungs and body during <b>systole</b>. Thus, the flow of electrical signal helps maintain the constant <a href=heart_blood_flow.html>flow of blood through the heart</a>. </p>
