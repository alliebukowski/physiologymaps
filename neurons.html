                <p><b>Neurons</b>—also called <b>nerve cells</b>—are the functional cell of the nervous system. The main function of neurons is to transmit signals, either a.) sensory information from the periphery to the central nervous system (via afferent, or sensory, pathways), or b.) motor information from the central nervous system to the periphery (via efferent, or motor, pathways). </p>

                <p>Neurons transmit signals by receiving and passing on (propagating) <b>action potentials</b>. Neuronal action potentials are rapid movements of ions across cell membranes that can be "passed along" down the length of an axon, resulting in transmission of electrical signal. In neurons, action potentials are triggered when dendrites receive some signal from a nearby neuron. Action potentials must travel down the entire length of a neuron’s axon, in order to pass on signal to the next neuron (or to the organ it innervates).</p>
                <p> Action potentials are created and propagated by the local movements of ions across cell membranes. </p>

                <p>Whenever a neuron passes on its signal to another cell, it does so at a <b>synapse</b> (a space or communication point between the nerve cell and another cell). The cell before the synapse (that is releasing signal from its axon terminal into the synapse) is the <b>presynaptic cell</b>. The cell after the synapse (that has receptors that will receive the signal from the first cell) is the <b>postsynaptic cell</b>. A neuron can synapse on another neuron, or a neuron can synapse on an effector organ.</p>

                <p>There are two main types of <b>synapses</b>: 1.) <b>electrical synapses</b> (where ions, or electrical current, are passed from one cell to the next), or 2.) <b>chemical synapses</b> (where neurotransmitters cross from one cell to the next).</p>

                <p>There are two main types of <b>postsynaptic receptors</b> (receptors on postsynaptic cells that are activated by neurotransmitters after crossing the synapse): 1.) <b>ionotropic receptors</b> (which directly open ion channels), or 2.) <b>metabotropic receptors</b> (which trigger another signaling cascade, or second messenger system).</p>

                <p>There are two main types of <b>effects</b> that can be triggered when the postsynaptic receptors are activated: 1.) <b>excitatory responses</b>, or 2.) <b>inhibitory responses</b>. Whether a response in excitatory or inhibitory depends on the ion channels that are affected, the neurotransmitter that is released, and/or the postsynaptic receptor that is activated.</p>

                <p>At <b>chemical synapses</b>, the signal that is passed from one cell to the next is composed of <b>neurotransmitters</b>, which are compounds that activate receptors in order to achieve their effects. When the action potential reaches the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron, neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminal, diffuse into the synaptic cleft, and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell. This act of neurotransmitter binding to its receptor on the other side of the synapse triggers a response in the postsynaptic cell.</p>

                <p><b>Ionotropic receptors</b>, when activated by a neurotransmitter, <b>directly open ion channels</b> on the membrane of the postsynaptic cell.

                <p> Ionotropic receptors create an <b>excitatory response</b> when they <b>open Na+ channels</b> on the postsynaptic membrane (depicted in both examples above). In both of the depicted cases, the binding of neurotransmitter at the postsynaptic cell opens Na+/K+ channels, Na+ rushes into the postsynaptic cell, and it causes a depolarization (an excitatory response, because it helped the cell get closer to its depolarization threshold). In <b>neurons</b>, this begins a new action potential. In <b>skeletal muscle</b>, this depolarization begins a contraction. </p>

                <p>Ionotropic receptors create an <b>inhibitory response</b> when they <b>open Cl- channels</b> on the postsynaptic membrane (not depicted). When Cl- channels are opened, Cl- rushes into the postsynaptic cell (Cl- has an equilibrium potential of about -75mL, so it will want to move to make the inside of the cell more negative). This makes the postsynaptic cell's membrane potential more negative and farther away from its depolarization threshold (an inhibitory response, because it is now harder for the cell to depolarize).</p>
